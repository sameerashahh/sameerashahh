## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a senior currently researching automated program tools like GenProg and PREP. I previously interned at Apple, where I worked on full-stack development with Swift, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes. Iâ€™ve also conducted research in applied machine learning, focusing on ML workflows through checkpointing, serialization, and dimensionality reduction at Stanford University.

In college, Iâ€™m an active member of the Society of Women Engineers and Women in Computer Science and outside of work, I enjoy dancing, playing soccer, and pickleball!
