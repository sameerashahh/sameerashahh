## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sameera

- Iâ€™m a senior currently researching automated program repair tools like GenProg and PREP, and am also working on developing a chatbot for cancer patients.
- I previously interned at Apple, where I worked on full-stack development with Swift, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes. 
- Iâ€™ve also done research at Stanford University in applied machine learning, focusing on ML workflows through checkpointing, serialization, and dimensionality reduction.

In college, Iâ€™m an active member of the Society of Women Engineers and Women in Computer Science and outside of work and school, I enjoy dancing, playing soccer, and pickleball!
